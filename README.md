# Train-Scheduler

Homework 07: Train Scheduler

This webpage takes data about train arrival times from any user  and displays them onto the page. Any user can visit the site and see the additions. Every time the page is refreshed, the "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" column will refresh depending on the current time.

## Implementation

### Bootstrap
- Layout
    - Rows
    - Columns
- Cards
- Tables
- Form Input
    - Text Area
    - Dropdowns

### jQuery
- DOM Manipulation
    - Access elements to create event handlers
    - Add elements dynamically

### Firebase
- Keep track of form input data
    - Train Name
    - Destination
    - First Train Time
    - Frequency

### Moment
- Parse time
- Add and subtract two times
- Compare a time with current time

## Future Improvements
1. Add delete/update train info functionality
2. Incorporate last train time
3. Refresh next train time and minutes away time every minute
